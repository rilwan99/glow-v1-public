#![allow(unused)]
//! Convert between interest rates and ticket prices.
//!
//! This has three different implementations for three different ways of
//! defining "interest rate": APR, APY, and Nominal. Not all are currently in
//! use, but they're kept around to enable easy swapping out as we decide how to
//! show interest to users in the ui. At some point, we may decide to display
//! different types of interest in different parts of the ui.
//!
//! Definitions:
//! - interest rate: general term for a number that represents growth in value.
//!   may or may not involve compounding. r% interest represents growth from x
//!   to x plus r% of x.
//! - yield: the actual growth in value of an investment, including any
//!   potential effects of compounding.
//! - nominal rate: The rate of return that does not include compounding.
//!   Typically, it has a compounding period that differs from the rate term.
//!   For example, you may have a compounding period of 1 month, and your yield
//!   over that month would be 1%. The yearly nominal rate is calculated by
//!   multiplying the monthly rate of return by 12, which is 12%. Likewise, this
//!   ignores the effects of compounding. To calculate actual yield, you need to
//!   know both the rate term and the compounding period.
//! - continuous nominal rate: Nominal rate with an instantaneous compounding
//!   period. Yield is calculated by compounding this rate continuously.
//! - price: the price of a ticket. price = 1 / (1 + yield)
//! - APY: Annual Percent Yield: yield that would be realized after one year.
//! - APR: Annual Percent Rate: continuous nominal rate with a yearly term.
